Brunch is a weekly list of articles, videos, and podcasts about programming, tech, and finding yourself in the industry.

The main purpose is to create a "vault" for me so I could re-visit the links without wondering where the hell did I read about the stuff.

The idea is based on excellent Avdi Grimm's [brunch](https://www.rubytapas.com/category/brunch/) I highly recommend. :)
