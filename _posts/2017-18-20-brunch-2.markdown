* This time we start with Vidya Narayanan, ex-google woman tech lead, [who is sick about current approach to diversity in IT](https://medium.com/the-mission/im-an-ex-google-woman-tech-leader-and-i-m-sick-of-our-approach-to-diversity-17008c5fe999)

* Read thru Jasson Shen's [Lessons on Interviewing for Product Manager Roles](https://www.jasonshen.com/2017/interviewing-for-product-manager-roles/). Actually, this bit is not only for managers, because everyone can capitialize on the big picture that emerges out of it.

* Read a write up by Eric Normand with story [why LISP was one of the greatest idea in programming, and how we still use it today](dev.to/ericnormand/the-idea-of-lisp).

* Why should you care about [async/await](https://blog.patricktriest.com/what-is-async-await-why-should-you-care/) and it can make your code much easier to write and follow.
